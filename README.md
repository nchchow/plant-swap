# Plantify

Web app that matches and notifies plant traders when they like each other's plants.

## Motivation

At home, we have a solid collection of plants, and weâ€™re also introducing a new puppy into our home. We will have to make space for him, so I thought it would be a good idea to trade some plants away for smaller ones.
